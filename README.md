### TODO:

- [ ] Add a way to gain tiles
    - Per x experience gained
        - Optionally charge the XP to unlock the tiles
    - Per x levels gained
        - Always charge the level to unlock the tiles (levels cost more xp at higher levels)
- [ ] Handle Nether/End travel if no available tiles
- [ ] Only use a tile if you are touching the ground?
    - Or using a boat
- [ ] What happens when you die and respawn in a bed with no available tiles and no unlocked tiles by the bed
    - Move player to closest tile if more than 1 block distance from last tile?
- [ ] Tile overlays
    - Show on top of all blocks that have non full blocks above them?
    - Add overlay to every full block and remove when block is broken?
- [ ] Customisations
    - [ ] Choose a tile color (maybe)
    - [ ] Choose a difficulty
        - Easy
