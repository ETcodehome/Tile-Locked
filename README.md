# About
Tile Locked is a Minecraft datapack that draws inspiration from [ChunkLock](https://modrinth.com/datapack/chunklock) and the Old School RuneScape [Tileman Mode](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/tilemanmode), offering players a unique and challenging gameplay experience.

The core mechanic of Tile Locked revolves around the incremental unlocking of the Minecraft world with a cost of xp or levels per tile unlock. Unlike traditional gameplay where the entire world is accessible from the start, this datapack limits players to unlocking one tile at a time.

This adds an extra layer of strategy and preparation, as players must carefully choose which tiles to unlock first, considering the resources and challenges needed to progress.
